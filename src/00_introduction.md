# Introduction

This is the mixer guide for the Covenant service at Bethany, written by Matthew Song.

If this is your first time using the mixer, I would recommend navigating to the [**Worship Setup**](01_before_worship_setup.md) and going through it to get a grasp of your responsibilities.

Otherwise, use this guide as a quick reference on how to do certain tasks on the mixer. You can find these quick referrences easily under it's respective group, **Quick Reference**.
