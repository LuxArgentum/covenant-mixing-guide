# Ready Mixer For Setup

As soon as you can get into the sanctuary, you will need to do a pre-worship setup. This is around 30 minutes, usually from 11:30 am to 12:00 pm. Sometimes, the BYG service can take longer, requiring you to need speed.

## Gather Equipment

The first thing you need to do is grab all the equipment, or sometimes find them around the sanctuary. Depending on who praise team is today, the equipment you need is different.

### Microphones

The first equipment you should be looking for are the microphones. The importance of each microphone goes from the lowest number up i.e. microphones #1 and #2 should be used first before microphones #7 and #8.

Often times, microphone 1, 2, and 7 are used for the praise team while microphone 8 is used for the speaker. 

**Equipment List:**

- Mic 1
- Mic 2
- Mic 7
- Mic 8
- KR 3 Pastor Mic
- IEM 1
- IEM 2

**The setup for microphones should be:**

- Lead singer: microphone 1
- Supporting singer: microphone 2
- Piano singer: microphone 7

These can change and you should be aware of which singer is using which microphone so that you can properly adjust their gain and volume.

### Monitors

The next equipment you should look for are the monitors. Specifically, the IEMs, or In-Ear Monitors. Peter Song, a member of the praise team, requires IEM #1 to hook up to his in-ears.

When you start working with the mixer, you will need to first switch the scene profile to the "Covenant" scene.

1. Find and press the scene button.
2. Navigate to the "Covenant" scene

The mixer fades should move to their set positions and you are ready to start pre-worship setup.
