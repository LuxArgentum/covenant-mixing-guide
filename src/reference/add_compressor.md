# How To Add A Compressor

![Mixer Knobs](images/mixer_knobs.png)

To add a compressor, press the button under **Comp**. The button should glow green if the compressor is on. You can adjust the compression with the knob.

I would recommend using one of the factory presets from the preset library to get a good starting point for the specific compressor you need. Refer to [How To Access The Preset Library](access_preset_library.md)
