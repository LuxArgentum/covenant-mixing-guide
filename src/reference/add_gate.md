![Mixer Knobs](images/mixer_knobs.png)

To add a gate, press the button under the **Gate** Section, located in the top-right of the mixer knobs. The button should glow green, meaning that the gate is on. You can turn the knob to adjust the gate cut off.

If you are trying to filter out noise with the gate, you can use the Noise Gate preset inside the library. If you don't know how to use the presets, refer to [How To Access The Preset Library](access_preset_library.md)
